## Step 1
I went online and I downloaded a cat video.

## Step 2 - Google Cloud CDN
I created a bucket using Google Cloud and changed the access to public. From here, I was able to get a url.

I chose GCP because of my issue with Azure and I was nervous because we didnt go over it in class, but it was simple. When setting up the CDN, I would just double check that the setting are correct and that there is public access. It should then just let you copy the url.

## Step 3- Flask App with TailwindCSS
Using the URL and the code from class I was able to change styling and add my video.

## Step 4 Deploying on GCP 

Deploying the flask app through GCP was straightforward and I followed the instructions present in class 2 HHA 506. From Here I created a new project entitled Flaskhw which has an id flaskhw422239. From Here i did gcloud config set project [PROJECT_ID] with the correct ID. I then added a .yaml file because I realized I had not copied that over. I had to make sure that I was in the right directory. S0 that was flask_5_tailwind. From there I did gcloud app deploy.

An error that I ran into was that I kept trying to deploy the app and I was getting things that said ERROR: (gcloud.app) Command name argument expected. or command not found. But then I realized when I was copy and pasting gcloud app deploy, there must have been an added space or some weird formatting because then it ultimately worked!

Initially I was going to deploy on Azure, but then I saw that my subsciption to Azure for Students was disabled, which was not a good sign. So that is why I switched to GCP, and thankfully was able to deploy successfully.

I was able to deploy the app, and then I disabled the application.
